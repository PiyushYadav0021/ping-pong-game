# 🏓 Ping Pong Game (HTML, CSS, JS)

A browser-based Ping Pong game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with code generated and guided by GPT-4.1. Built as part of my learning journey into front-end web development and game logic.

## 🧠 How It Was Made
The entire project was designed with the help of GPT-4.1. I prompted the AI step-by-step to generate the code structure, styling, and logic, then tested and assembled it into a complete working game. The goal was to explore how AI can assist in hands-on learning and rapid prototyping.
